When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to make sure that you have a safe copy of your work, and when you want to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual changes allow you to pull when you decide you need to sync your repository
    with the remote repository. An automatic sync might sync working copies that you don't
    want publically known.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    You fork a repository when you do not have permission to modify it. You clone a repository
    to have a copy in a different place, either remotely or on another computer. You create a branch in 
    a repository when you want to have a fresh copy and still have the original branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It gives you the opportunity to use examine the differences between the local code and the 
    remote code without neccessarily being in touch with the remote repository.
